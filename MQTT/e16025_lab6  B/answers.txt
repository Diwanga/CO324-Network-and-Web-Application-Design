====================
I implemented one client program which can publish and subscribe to Task API.
As mentioned in Part A, I created my solution.

You can create may instance at once with 
                                 
                                      python client.py

and interact withTASK API.  

****  my Task ID is created with {clientname}_{count}. So it is unique for Task. 
      So when Starting program You Are asked to give client name. & remember it. 
For delete and update operation needs that. 
I recomend use C1,C2.. so then your task id will be C1_1,C1_2... so on.
AND ALSO I HAVE CREATED  LIST oparation, you can easily see what are in list.

This programm is fully functional with command line user inputs. 
locally, tasks ara stored in dictionary.
